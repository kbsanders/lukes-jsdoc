================

This project provides a JSDoc and a collection of plugin's that I use
on most of my JavaScript projects.

## Inspiration, Origins, & Acknowledgements

After searching for and trying several JSDoc themes I found the
_excellent_ [loke-theme](https://github.com/LOKE/jsdoc-theme), which
provided a well crafted theme, a collection of plugins, and a ton of
good advice.

However, I wanted to extend upon what the [loke-theme](https://github.com/LOKE/jsdoc-theme)
provided me by adding more plugins, changing the theme a bit, and making
the module more inclusive and robust.  My vision was to have a single
module that I could include to provide most, if not all, of my source
documentation needs.

This module was born from that vision.  I use this module internally,
for my own purposes, in production.  I do not know if anyone else will
ever find it useful, but wanted to make it public just-in-case; I hope
that you find value in it.

#### Why I Didn't Fork

Large portions of the [loke-theme](https://github.com/LOKE/jsdoc-theme)
have been copied into this project.  I considered different approaches
to doing this, like simply including it as a dependency or forking it,
but ultimately decided to just use it as the foundation of my own,
stand-alone, project.

The main reason I decided to copy and modify, rather than fork or
include, was because these sorts of projects are generally not designed
to be forked, extended, or included.  The [loke-theme](https://github.com/LOKE/jsdoc-theme)
project, like the [minami](https://github.com/nijikokun/minami) project
that it used as its basis, provide a complete thought or opinion.  My
alterations fundamentally change that thought and opinion, and I think
that warrants a new project.

But I do want to make clear that most of the initial hard work was
provided by the [loke-theme](https://github.com/LOKE/jsdoc-theme)
project and the [minami](https://github.com/nijikokun/minami) project,
and they are due a majority of the credit.

As time goes on, I am likely to deviate ever further away from the
aforementioned origin projects and I intend to include a number of
features that they do not.
